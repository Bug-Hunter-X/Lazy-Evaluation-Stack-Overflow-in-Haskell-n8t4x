This Haskell code suffers from a subtle bug related to lazy evaluation and infinite data structures.  The function `sumInfiniteList` attempts to sum an infinite list, which will lead to a stack overflow or non-termination. The problem arises because Haskell's lazy evaluation doesn't force the evaluation of the list's elements until they are needed, leading to a never-ending recursive call.

```haskell
infiniteList = 1 : infiniteList

sumInfiniteList :: [Integer] -> Integer
sumInfiniteList xs = sum xs

main :: IO ()
main = print $ sumInfiniteList infiniteList
```
