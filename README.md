This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in Haskell related to lazy evaluation and infinite data structures. The `bug.hs` file contains code that attempts to sum an infinite list, which results in a stack overflow. The `bugSolution.hs` file provides a corrected version, showcasing how to handle such scenarios effectively.  Lazy evaluation is a powerful feature of Haskell, but it requires careful consideration when dealing with potentially infinite structures.
